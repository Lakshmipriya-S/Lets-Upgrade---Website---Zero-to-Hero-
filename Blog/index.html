        <p> Balance is not something you find, It is something you create. It's truly the perspective you carry on.</p>
        <p>To create your own kind of a happy balance, keep moving on, and spend quality time on your choices.</p>
        <p>Indeed we have got a lot of dreams to be achieved which may not be the same as our career goals. What do we do about it? </p>
        <p>Change our goals and dreams? Make it just one? </p>
        <p>NO, right? Even if we did, I'm sure, we won't end up being happy. After all, what is that we expect at the end of the day?, " Peace of Mind ". </p>
        <p>From my experiences, " It's always about the quality we put into anything we do and never about the time we spent on it ".  </p>
        <p>If you are perfectly able to separate the time between your Work and Life, according to my opinion, "There's definitely something wrong about your work or your personal life". </p>
